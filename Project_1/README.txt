1. Briefly discuss how you implemented your recursive client functionality.

My recursive function is listening on port provided by the user and opening the file where the dnshost are creates a list, then upon client requesting for dns lookup and when the server gets a request it will go ahead and look into its file and checks if the host exists and I am able to find one because I seem to not understand right now that why my requests are not incrementing but that problem lies on the client side. But as expected it is supposed to be sending back the string it finds.
 
2. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your
attached code? If so, explain.

I am having my client code where I have the for loop running through tokens to send packets one by one but it is not currently doing that and I just need more time to do this since I have been working on this on buy own. 

3. What problems did you face developing code for this project? 

The loop that is not listening to me but I may be doing something wrong but I needed more time to figure it out but I will get this done for sure 

4. What did you learn by working on this project?
I learned a lot and im in love
